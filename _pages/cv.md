* M.S.E. in Data Science, University of Pennsylvania, 2019

Work experience
======
* Paylocity Corporation - Data Scientist (Aug 2021 - Present)
  * As a Data Scientist, I'm actively involved in the development and deployment of ML, Deep Learning and NLP models to Paylocity's suite of HCM and Engagement products in order to enable, ensure and improve customer experiences related to workforce scheduling, query searching, content moderation, etc. when using our products
  * I'm also involved in the development and deployment of ML pipelines for automating production-scale model training, inference and monitoring workflows
  * Tools I'm currently using at Paylocity - TensorFlow, Prophet, Optuna, MLflow, Databricks, Data Factory, EMR, Pulumi, React 

* Quantiphi, Inc. - ML Engineer (Jul 2019 - Jul 2021)
  * As a ML Engineer, I was involved in the development and deployment of ML and Deep Learning models to the production (cloud) environments of Quantiphi's clients which included developing demand forecasting models for a US-based billion dollar restaurants business and a multinational billion dollar cosmetics business, enabling them to understand their respective product sales trends & patterns and hence make data-driven decisions to address their inventory management and staffing needs along with improving their marketing initiatives
  * I was also involved in the development and deployment of ML pipelines for automating production-scale model training, inference and monitoring workflows
  * Additionally, I briefly consulted on a few other client projects such as development of a demand forecasting model for a consumer goods business, and development of a video recognition model for a food & beverages business
  * Tools I used at Quantiphi - TensorFlow, Prophet, R, Lambda, SageMaker, Fargate, Boto3, Vertex AI, Kubeflow, OpsGenie

* Byton North America Corporation - Data Science Intern (Summer 2018)
  * As a Data Science Intern, I was involved in the development of a Deep Learning model to estimate the (approximate) remaining driving range of Byton's concept electric car at any given time based on car battery and GPS signals, thus allowing for a more accurate battery recharge alarming system
  * I was also involved in market data analysis of electric car sales to identify car features that tend to drive certain sales patterns
  * Tools I used at Byton - Jupyter, PyTorch, Plotly
